  <h2>Common Issues</h2>

  <h3>1. Chart Not Rendering</h3>
  <p>If your chart is not displaying as expected, start by verifying that the <code>data</code> list is not empty. An empty dataset will prevent the chart from rendering any visual elements. Additionally, ensure that valid size parameters are provided; check that the width and height of the chart are set appropriately and that they are not constrained by parent widgets.</p>

  <h3>2. Animation Issues</h3>
  <p>If you are experiencing problems with animations, first check if the animation duration is reasonable. Extremely short or long durations can lead to unexpected behavior. Also, confirm that the widget is disposed of correctly when navigating away from the screen or when the chart is no longer needed. Improper disposal can lead to lingering animations or memory leaks.</p>

  <h3>3. Style Not Applying</h3>
  <p>If the styles you have defined are not being applied to the chart, verify the style properties you have set. Ensure that they are correctly defined and that there are no typos. Additionally, check the constraints of the parent widget; if the parent widget has restrictive constraints, it may prevent the child chart from rendering with the intended styles.</p>

  <h3>4. Data Not Updating</h3>
  <p>If your chart is not reflecting updated data, ensure that you are using a state management solution that properly triggers a rebuild of the chart when the data changes. Verify that the data source is being updated correctly and that the chart widget is listening for those changes.</p>

  <h3>5. Performance Lag</h3>
  <p>If you notice performance issues, such as lag or stuttering during animations, consider optimizing your dataset. Large datasets can significantly impact rendering performance. If possible, limit the number of data points displayed at one time or implement data aggregation techniques to reduce the load.</p>

  <h3>6. Inconsistent Appearance Across Devices</h3>
  <p>If the chart appears differently on various devices, check for hardcoded values in your layout. Use relative sizing and positioning to ensure that the chart adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. Testing on multiple devices can help identify and resolve these inconsistencies.</p>

  <h3>7. Error Messages</h3>
  <p>If you encounter error messages while using the Material Charts package, carefully read the error output. Common issues may include type mismatches, null values, or incorrect parameters. Use the error messages as a guide to troubleshoot and resolve the underlying issues.</p>

  <h3>8. Documentation Gaps</h3>
  <p>If you find that the documentation does not cover a specific feature or use case, consider reaching out to the community or maintainers for clarification. You can also contribute by suggesting improvements or additions to the documentation based on your experiences.</p>

  <p>By following these troubleshooting tips, you can effectively resolve common issues encountered while using the Material Charts package. If you continue to experience problems, consider reaching out to the community through <a href="https://github.com/vishnudas-bluefox/material_charts/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a> for further assistance. Your feedback is invaluable in improving the package for all users!</p>
